Hi! I'm Ignacio Occhipinti, and this is the trial version of PALAN'T, a light-capture video game developed in Processing.

PLOT
You play as a congressman, and your objective in the game is to collect as much money as possible while avoiding touching the shovels and projects falling from the sky. There are checkpoints that activate when you reach a specific amount of money, restoring all your lives and temporarily halting the descent of shovels and projects while making money rain.
